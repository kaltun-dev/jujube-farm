problems
problem 1

 css wasnt beeing applied to html page in the browsser
 ive linked they sttle sgeets in all the pages but it wasnt linking ive tried stack and google but found nothing. 
 solved promelem by git add and git commit and git push.

 problem 2 

 logo h1 not displaying styling as per css rules.
 created new menue class and made display inline block. 

problem 3
hero image is too large taking the whole page and even more.

i've googled and change max-width to 100% and made height- auto but that changed nothing. trield to look at the love running project for help but that didnt work too. so i found a youtube video about the hero image and made some adjustments to the css again. that method didnt work either. so chose anothero picure and rezised it to 1600 by 500px. that sort of sorted the hero picture. but everthis was still a big mess, image was still rather too large. i will just move on the the other sections, so i dont lose a lot of time on this image, and ask help from my tutor. 
finally after soe reasearch i changed height to 69vh and width to 100%. and it works finally, for now.

problem 4

container3 center div icon is not diplaying even though the other icons are displaying fine.

i have replaced it with another icon and that seemed to have worked.
